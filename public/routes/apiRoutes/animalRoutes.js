// 11.2.3 First, notice that this is just another method of the router object that allows us to create routes, much like router.get(). This method doesn't say get thoughâ€”it says post, which means that we defined a route that listens for POST requests, not GET requests. POST requests differ from GET requests in that they represent the action of a client requesting the server to accept data rather than vice versa.//

router.post("/animals", (req, res) => {
  // set id based on what the next index of the array will be
  req.body.id = animals.length.toString();

  // if any data in req.body is incorrect, send 400 error back
  if (!validateAnimal(req.body)) {
    res.status(400).send("The animal is not properly formatted.");
  } else {
    const animal = createNewAnimal(req.body, animals);
    res.json(animal);
  }
});
